# Random Inspiration
_Inspiration can come from anywhere, so why not the some random website on the internet._

Random Inspiration is a random quote generator that uses a public API to present the user with quotes that should, in theory, inspire. Sometimes they just confuse, though.

Students will create all of the HTML, CSS, and Javascript for this assignment, from scratch. The design of the website should be simple, elegant, and also inspired by the pattern illustration, from local artist Hannah Cook ([@hawnuhlee](https://www.instagram.com/hawnuhlee/)).

### Concepts Introduced or Enforced
- JSON objects
- Javascript objects
- AJAX

### Resources Provided
- **Quote API**: http://quotesondesign.com/api/3.0/api-3.0.json
- **Inspiration Image**: hawnuhlee_inspiring.jpg
- **Chrome Dev Security Toggle Info**: [Remember that this is dangerous](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3102819/disable-same-origin-policy-in-chrome)

## Required Functionality
- On page load, a quote loads from the API and is displayed on the web page.
- When user clicks the "Get Inspired" button, a new quote is fetched from the API and is displayed on the web page. (Note: the API gives only one quote a minute.)
- The web page's design must be inspired by the below illustration (get creative).
<img src="hawnuhlee_inspiring.jpg" width= "90%" style="max-width: 500px" />
- Credit for the site's design inspiration must be given somewhere on the site, with a link to Hannah's [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/hawnuhlee/).
